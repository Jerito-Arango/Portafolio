    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently studying Systems Engineering and have a deep passion for technology, music, 
      and problem-solving. I specialize in programming with C++, Java, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
      In addition to my technical background, I am also a pianist who loves to explore the creative 
      side of life through music.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recently participated in a programming project that involved developing an 
      <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> system to recognize AI-generated images. This was made for a first semester project in the university. 
      This experience allowed me to expand my knowledge in machine learning and computer vision, 
      and I look forward to applying these skills in future endeavors.

      <h3>Project 1: AI Image Recognition</h3>
      <p>
        A collaborative project aimed at creating an AI system to identify images generated by 
        other AI models. This involved data preprocessing, model training, and developing a 
        user-friendly interface to visualize results.

      <h3>Project 2: Videogame in progress for Engineering project</h3>
      <p>
        For the second semester of my career, we have an engineering project regarding the development of an RPG videogame.
        This project is just in its initial phase and the objetive is to finish it by the end of the semester. Because of this reason, we still don't have any visual media to present de project

      <h3>Project 3: Piano projects</h3>
      <p>
       As an engineer, I only have one semester of experience, because of this, the two previous are the only coding-related projects that I have done.
       Regardless, I have also participated in important events and projects regarding piano playing and piano projects. The most prominent of them all is 
       a project which consisted in giving our classical music interpretation in countries in Europe (Bulgaria and Austria).

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
      When I'm not coding, I love spending time playing the piano and exploring different musical 
      genres. Music helps me think creatively and provides a balance to my technical pursuits. 
      I also enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest technology trends, reading about AI and 
      machine learning breakthroughs, and collaborating on open-source projects to refine my skills.
